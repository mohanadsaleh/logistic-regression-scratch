# 🧠 Logistic Regression from Scratch – Banknote Authentication

This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using:

- Batch Gradient Descent  
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [UCI Banknote Authentication](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)  
**Goal:** Classify whether a banknote is genuine or forged based on 4 features.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load and preprocess data
2. Implement logistic regression manually using NumPy
3. Train models using BGD and SGD
4. Plot loss curves and evaluate accuracy and confusion matrix

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
